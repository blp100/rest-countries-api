## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I learned how to implement RESTful API with vanilla Javascript. Well, I must admit, it was more enjoyable using React to build a component. However, it's still valuable to learn how to write vanilla JavaScript through this RESTful API challenge.

### Useful resources

- [tailwindcss safelist](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69687530/dynamically-build-classnames-in-tailwindcss) - I didn't know this before, and it's good to have resolved many challenges I faced previously.
- [A modern JavaScript router in 100 lines](https://krasimirtsonev.com/blog/article/A-modern-JavaScript-router-in-100-lines-history-api-pushState-hash-url) - I tried to implement dynamic routers in vanilla JavaScript, and I found it really cool. In the end, I chose another way to implement it, but I'm still glad I had the time to explore JavaScript's capabilities and learn from master programmer.
